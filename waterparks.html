<p>This park, located in Ras Al Khaimah (approximately 75 minutes from Dubai), doesn&#8217;t have the designs and themes adorned by Dubai&#8217;s water parks. It&#8217;s light on the frills but heavy on the thrills; here&#8217;s it&#8217;s all about the water slides&#151;that earns Ice Land a mention on this list. The park has about 20 rides evenly split between thrill and gentleness so this makes it a good spot for everyone! It also worth mentioning that this park has the world&#8217;s largest man-made waterfall.</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve covered some intense water rides; so this one&#8217;s for the kids! LEGOLAND as a whole is catered primarily for family fun, especially families with kids aged 2&#151;12. That&#8217;s why this parks excels at catering to that age group. But don&#8217;t worry, this water park is still exceptionally fun.
Highlights: Unique concepts like customizing your own raft out of Legos and then taking it for a dive! The park has plenty of water slides that offer exhilarating dives and swings that&#8217;d give all ages some fun.
