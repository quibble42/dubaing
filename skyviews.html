<h1 id="skyviews"><quasi>Top 5 Stunning Dubai </quasi>City Views<quasi> from the Sky</quasi></h1> 
<h4>The most spectacular views of Dubai would need you to get your feet off the ground. Conveniently, the city offers many ways of getting your eyes high up in the sky.</h4>



<h3>1. Sky Diving<span class='blufy'> &#150; Best Dubai Views</span></h3>
<p>The unarguable champion for the experience of a lifetime in Dubai, while offering unimaginable views of the city: <span class='yellify'>Sky Diving</span>. Sky diving views in Dubai are so brilliant that they&#8217;ve made their way into popular song videos. This honor is easily well-earned. You get to choose your locations, varying from the Palm Jumeirah to beautiful beach sceneries.</p>
<p>This will undoubtedly be costly but this is something that you will remember and tell stories about for the rest of your life!</p>
<p><b>Average Price:</b> AED 2,000&#150;2,500<br>
<b>Time Dedication:</b> 1 Hour<br>

</p>



<h3>2. Air Ballooning<span class='blufy'> &#150; Best Dubai Views</span></h3>
<p>Dubai has many companies operating <span class='yellify'>Air Balloons</span>. The air balloons offer a thrilling view of the city and you can control the height and angles with which you want to see the city. You can even control what areas become your central point of vision (Burh Khalifa observatory is a fixed center of vision) and the times you see them.</p>
<p>This allows you to get the magical sights of the desert during dusk and dawn, as the sun paints the sky a reddish orange, and an opportunity to see the Dubai city from the heights and lows of your desires of all the locations.</p>
<p><b>Average Price:</b> AED 750<br>
<b>Time Dedication:</b> 1&#150;2 Hours<br>

<h3>3. Helicopter<span class='blufy'> &#150; Best Dubai Views</span></h3>
<p><span class='yellify'>Helicopter</span> views are a popular activity in most tourist destinations. Dubai has many companies competing to offer the most exciting experience with helicopters. The experience, though, is usually short and generally the trip lasts no more than 30 minutes. But those 30 minutes will be nothing less than a magical memory. </p>
<p>Though, unlike the air balloon, most helicopter tours will follow a pre-planned route and will offer little means of customization. Nonetheless, you will get to see the city exactly the way it does in the panoramic photos seen in tourist brochures. And it&#8217;s safe to say that being in a helicopter is an experience in itself. </p>
<p><b>Average Price:</b> AED 350<br>
<b>Time Dedication:</b> 30 Minutes<br>

<h3>5. At The Top at Burj Khalifa<span class='blufy'> &#150; Best Dubai Views</span></h3>
<p>Burj Khalifa&#8217;s <span class='yellify'>At The Top</span> is the most common and affordable way of getting a sky-high view of the city. It sets you 456m above the ground on the 124th &amp; 125th floors of the tallest building in the world. Infants enter free (age 4 or less), but adults are allowed inside for a base rate of AED 125 between 8.30 AM to midnight; the only exception is 5.30 PM to 7 PM (sunset views would cost AED 200). </p>
<p><b>Average Price:</b> AED 125; AED 200 during sunset hours<br>
<b>Time Dedication:</b> 30 Minutes<br>

<h3>5. At The Top Sky at Burj Khalifa<span class='blufy'> &#150; Best Dubai Views</span></h3>
<p>Burj Khalifa&#8217;s <span class='yellify'>At The Top Sky</span> sets you at the building&#8217;s 148th level. This will cost AED 350 during normal hours and AED 500 during sunset hours. This is not recommended because the extra sum does not offer you a much better view. The difference is marginal because the views from the 124th &amp; 125th floors already give you a sight reaching to the depths of Dubai. </p>
<p>While Burj Khalifa&#8217;s observatories give a good view of the city, they are somewhat&#133;mundane. If you are a tourist from cities with skyscrapers, the views may not impress you. </p>
<p><b>Average Price:</b> AED 350; AED 500 during sunset hours<br>
<b>Time Dedication:</b> 30 Minutes<br>
