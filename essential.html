<h3 id="exploredubaiwithadesertsafari">1. Explore Dubai with a Desert Safari<span class='blufy'> &#150; Essential Things to Do in Dubai</span></h3>
<p>The <span class='yellify'>safari</span> is a trip of a life-time: extremely enjoyable yet extremely affordable. Get ready for a fast and thrilling experience through the ups and downs of the desert dunes!</p>
<p>These will follow up with optional 4x4 or BMX rides through the desert, camel rides, and a night full of events ranging from colorful and vibrant traditional Arab dances to jaw-dropping belly dances. Of course, there&#8217;ll also be delicious BBQ meals for the guests; vegetarian diets are also supported.</p>
<p>Most safari operators will request you be picked up from a specific rendezvous, and a few will offer VIP packages which will involve a hotel pick-up. The safari operators work along with a desert camp operator to build an amazing experience. Dubai desert safaris take up 8 hours with all the amazing things they include. Avoid branding frills and focus on what extra features your money buys. <a href="adrenalinezones.html" class="atry">Also Try: Ranking&#150;Best Adrenaline Adventures in Dubai (Too much fun!)</a></p>

<h3>3. See Dubai&#8217;s Iconic Burj Al Arab<span class='blufy'> &#150; Essential Things to Do in Dubai</span></h3>
<p>Dubai is studded with iconic creations but one stands out as it has been crowned the world&#8217;s only 7-star hotel. A thing every resident &amp; tourist seeks to do in Dubai: Visit Burj Al Arab. You can get great photos with the Burj by either visiting it or by standing on the edge of the Madinat Jumeirah&#8217;s entrance bridge. Getting in can be expensive as you are required to book something to do inside the hotel, and everything inside runs a high price tag. </p>
<p>To get in, most people opt for a meal or tea. The cheapest price for even the tea is AED 300, however, if you call and reserve a haircut, you&#8217;d not only get hair styled from the world&#8217;s only 7-star hotel, but will also get entry inside the Burj al Arab for AED 200&#151;the cheapest possible cost of entry.</p>
<p>When you arrive at the gate of the Burj al Arab&#8217;s entrance, a security member will ask to see your reservation; be prepared with an e-mail, text message, or print-out of your reservation. <a href="comingsoon.html" class="atry">Also Try: Best Things to Do in Jumeirah (FREE!)</a></p>
