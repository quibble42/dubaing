This is a bit of a trip from Dubai and especially from farther emirates like Sharjah or Ajman.

This is popular amongst tourists as it offers a detailed look into the connection between the Emirati heritage and falcons. Visitors can interact with falcons and pet or hold them too. This may be an uninteresting visit if you seek a more action-packed and larger zoo with heavy variety of wildlife; neither Dubai nor other Emirates are short on those. But if you want to learn about the UAE&#8217;s heritage, interact with some wild life, and get to see a great display of animal care, this is an all-inclusive package for you. </p>
