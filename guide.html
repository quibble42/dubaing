 NOTES FOR  FORMATTING AND NAMING CONVENTIONS

Main titles and such get h1.
All categories get a div that encapsulates the entirety of the section.
Category headings get h1.
Subcategory headings (names of attractions) get h3.
Descriptions of categories get h4.

Title naming/category title naming/attraction naming is always all lowercase, no spaces. Ampersands are NOT ignored, but instead replaced with a lowercase "n". Punctuation is ignored, and the word "bonus:" is also ignored. Things in parentheses are ignored. If something has "and" instead of "&", the "and" is typed out. For example, "Dubai Theme & Water and Fountain" would be "dubaithemenwaterandfountain"

Category Div's (mentioned above) are the same convention as category title naming, except it is Propercase, with underscores where there would be spaces. For example, "Dubai Theme & Water and Fountain" would be "Dubai_Theme_N_Water_And_Fountain". Note that the "n" is capitalized. ***IF the name is one word, i.e. "Music", then the id for the category div will be "Music_" with an underscore after the word.

Nearly every name here is an "id" name. There are very few classes.

    <h1 id="dubaiguide">Dubai Guide</h1>
    <h1>Welcome to Your One Stop for Getting to Know Everything There is to do in Dubai!</h1> 
    
<h4 class="leftalignplease">Dubai is a city that has come a long way; booking your flight and hotel is essentially STEP ZERO. To truly revel in the best Dubai has to offer during your time here, you would need a commitment to discovering the most worthwhile activities, experiences, and views&#151;essentially a crafting of the best memories. <br></h4>
<h4 id="unless">Unless someone else does it for you. </h4>
<h4 class="leftalignplease">There are plenty of guides on travelling in Dubai. But we felt there was something missing: an authentic guide made from people who have lived and grown up here; people who live and breathe Dubai and know it inside-out.<br> 
Knowledge on making the best memories in Dubai & getting the best price for those memories, all in one place, is the Dubaing Guide to Dubai. </h4>


<div id="Making_Memories">
<h1 id="makingmemories">Making Memories</h1> 
<h4>We cover EVERYTHING there is to do in Dubai and discuss the highlights, and that much info can become a little overwhelming so we&#8217;ve made categories. Let your interests guide you through these categories! 
Please keep in mind that until our launch, we&#8217;ll only be able to provide you information; very soon you&#8217;ll be able to buy tickets, packages, and deals at the best prices, exclusively from us. </h4></div>















<div id="Dhows_N_Safaris">
<h1 id="dhowsnsafaris">Dubai Musts: Dhows &amp; Safaris</h1>
<h4>There are certain must-dos for each tourist destination. For Dubai, the safaris and dhows are a necessity.</h4>
<p>The safaris are a trip of a life-time, extremely enjoyable yet extremely affordable. Get ready for a fast and thrilling experience through the ups and downs of the desert dunes! These will follow up by optional 4x4 or BMX rides through the desert, camel rides, and a night full of events ranging from colorful and vibrant traditional arab dances to jaw-dropping belly dances. Of course, there&#8217;ll also be delicious BBQ meals for the guests; vegetarian diets are also supported. </p>
<p>Most safari operators will request you be picked up from a specific rendezvous, and a few will offer VIP packages which will involve hotel a pick-up. The safari operators work along with a desert camp operator to build an amazing experience. Dubai desert safaris take up 8 hours with all the amazing things they include. Avoid branding frills and focus on what extra features your money buys. Upon launch, we will offer deals for unbeatable rates on safaris. </p>
<p>The dhows are large traditional Arab boats: subtly lit, wooden, and hosting many activities. Unlike the thrills of a safari, these offer a more calm and relaxing environment as you drift through waters flowing through Dubai, capturing the best skyline in the world. Dhow trips are like a mini cruise and will last for a few hours, allowing you to enjoy a scrumptious meal, accommodating all sorts of diets. Dhow trips can take between 2 to 4 hours. Upon launch, we will offer the best deals for the most exciting dhows hosting the most delicious meals.</p></div>

<div id="City_Views_From_The_Sky">
<h1 id="cityviewsfromthesky">City Views from the Sky</h1> 
<h4>The most spectacular views of Dubai would need you to get your feet off the ground. Conveniently, the city offers many ways of getting your eyes high up in the sky.</h4> 
<p>Burj Khalifa&#8217;s At The Top is the most common and affordable way of getting a sky-high view of the city. It sets you 456m above the ground on the 124th &amp; 125th floors of the tallest building in the world. Infants enter free (age 4 or less), but adults are allowed inside for a base rate of AED 125 between 8.30 AM to midnight; the only exception is 5.30 PM to 7 PM (sunset views would cost AED 200). </p>
<p>Burj Khalifa&#8217;s At the Top Sky sets you at the building&#8217;s 148th level. This will cost AED 350 during normal hours and AED 500 during sunset hours. This is not recommended because the extra sum does not offer you a much better view. The difference is marginal because the views from the 124th &amp; 125th floors already give you a sight reaching to the depths of Dubai.</p>  
<p>While Burj Khalifa&#8217;s observatories give a good view of the city, they are somewhatâ€¦ boring. And if you are a tourist from cities with skyscrapers, the views would extremely mundane. And this certainly won&#8217;t be the experience that will build life-long memories.</p> 
<h3>For genuinely enjoyable times:</h3> 
<p>Dubai has many companies operating Air Balloons. The air balloons offer a thrilling view of a city and you can control the height and angles with which you want to see the city. You can even control what areas become your central point of vision (Burh Khalifa observatory is a fixed center of vision) and the times you see them.</p> <p>This allows you to get the magical sights of the desert during dusk and dawn, as the sun paints the sky a reddish orange, and an opportunity to see the Dubai city from the height peaks and lows of your desires of all the locations. Upon launch, we will offer the ultimate deals on the ultimate memory makers in Dubai: Air Balloons.</p>
<p>Helicopter views are a popular activity in most tourist destinations. Dubai has many companies competing to offer the most exciting experience with helicopters. The experience, though, is usually short and generally the trip lasts no more than 30 minutes. But those 30 minutes will be nothing less than a magical memory. Though, unlike the air balloon, most helicopter tours will follow a pre-planned route and will offer little means of customization. Nonetheless, you will get to see the city exactly the way it does in the panoramic photos seen in tourist brochures. And it&#8217;s safe to say that being in a helicopter is an experience in itself. Additionally, this is again better than the Burj Khalifa views as you get to see the city views from many, many locations rather than just one. Upon launch, we will offer deals with the best prices for the most enjoyable helicopter tours.</p> 
<p>The unarguable champion for the experience of a lifetime, while offering unimaginable views of the city: Sky Diving. Sky diving views in Dubai are so brilliant that they&#8217;ve made their way into popular song videos. This honor is easily well-earned. You get to choose your locations, variating from the Palm Jumeirah to beautiful beach sceneries. This will undoubtedly be costly but this is something that you won&#8217;t just remember, rather, you will tell stories of this adventure for the rest of your life! Upon launch, we will make efforts to offer the best deals for this once in a life time adventure. </p></div>
