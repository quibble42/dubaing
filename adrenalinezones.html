<h3 id="dubaigravityzone">1. Dubai Gravity Zone<span class='blufy'> &#150; Most Thrilling Height Attraction in Dubai</span></h3> 
<p>Here&#8217;s one for the true thrill seekers. Gravity Zone is Dubai&#8217;s prime bungee jumping offering. Don&#8217;t expect cliff-side views though. This bungee jump is based off a crane in an inner-city location. So pace up for an electrifying jump towards the ground at about 100 km/h! This would be a great opportunity to pleasantly take in some amazing views but the adrenaline rush might be an obstacle that. For those daring enough, the location offers a backwards jump too, and the romantics can do a tandem jump!</p>

<h3 id="dubaiautodrome">2. Dubai Autodrome<span class='blufy'> &#150; Best Car Attration in Dubai</span></h3>
<p>The Autodrome offers an experience that&#8217;s hard to replicate: driving an F1 race car! This one&#8217;s for you if you enjoy speed&#151;extreme speed. Truth be told, you have the option to race with a Lotus, an Audi R8 V10, and a McLaren, but those units cost more than an F1 drive, which starts at AED 875. Though, the true uniqueness of this experience lies in racing in an F1 car rather than a standard sports car, and this isn&#8217;t just for petrol heads; everyone can enjoy the thrill of racing in a Formula 1 car and live up those childhood dreams. </p>
<p>The Autodrome also features modified go-kart races in case you aren&#8217;t up for a F1 experience or are on a tighter budget. Additionally, if you&#8217;re more of a spectator, check the calendar dates and you might get lucky enough to see a motorsport race. </p>
